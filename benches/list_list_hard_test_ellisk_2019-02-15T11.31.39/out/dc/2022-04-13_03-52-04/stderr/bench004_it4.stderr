Improved score to -595.226406 (dScore=26.808037) w/ new primitive
	#(lambda (lambda (fold $1 empty (lambda (lambda (if ($2 $1) (cons $1 $0) $0)))))) : list(t0) -> (t0 -> bool) -> list(t0)

New primitive is used 3 times in the best programs in each of the frontiers.
Here is where it is used:
  (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (fold $1 empty (lambda (lambda (if ($2 $1) (cons $1 $0) $0)))))) $0 (lambda (is-prime (mod (+ $0 $0) #(+ 1 #(+ 1 (+ 1 1))))))))
