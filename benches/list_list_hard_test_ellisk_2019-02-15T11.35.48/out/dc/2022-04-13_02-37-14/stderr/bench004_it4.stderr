Here in the master worker: we still have 0 language alignments;
Scored candidates in 1.97097s.
Best MDL score: -646.468257 with (map (lambda (if (is-prime $0) 0 (+ $0 1))))
Scored candidates with language and grammar in 1.72711s.
Best joint score: -646.468257 with (map (lambda (if (is-prime $0) 0 (+ $0 1))))
Timing point 3 (all scoring): 3.7109s.
Improved score to -646.468257 (dScore=11.640381) w/ new primitive
	#(map (lambda (if (is-prime $0) 0 (+ $0 1)))) : list(int) -> list(int)
rewrote all of the frontiers in 5.5438s.
Timing point 4 (rewrite final frontiers): 5.54385s.

New primitive is used 2 times in the best programs in each of the frontiers.
Here is where it is used:
  (lambda (#(map (lambda (if (is-prime $0) 0 (+ $0 1)))) $0))
  (lambda (#(map (lambda (if (is-prime $0) 0 (+ $0 1)))) $0))
