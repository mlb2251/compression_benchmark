Timing point 3 (all scoring): 3.40143s.
Improved score to -549.670978 (dScore=4.036189) w/ new primitive
	#(lambda (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (fold $1 $0 (lambda (lambda (cons $1 $0)))))) $1 (cons $0 empty)))) : list(t0) -> t0 -> list(t0)
rewrote all of the frontiers in 4.43588s.
Timing point 4 (rewrite final frontiers): 4.43593s.
Completed one step of memory consolidation in 21.6205s.
New primitive is used 4 times in the best programs in each of the frontiers.
Here is where it is used:
  (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (fold $1 $0 (lambda (lambda (cons $1 $0)))))) $1 (cons $0 empty)))) $0 0))
  (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (fold $1 $0 (lambda (lambda (cons $1 $0)))))) $1 (cons $0 empty)))) $0 (+ #(+ 1 1) 1)))
