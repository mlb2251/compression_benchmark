Timing point 3 (all scoring): 11.7562s.
Improved score to -1306.967252 (dScore=4.867546) w/ new primitive
	#(lambda (lambda (map (lambda (index $0 $2)) (range $0)))) : list(t0) -> int -> list(t0)

New primitive is used 3 times in the best programs in each of the frontiers.
Here is where it is used:
  (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (map (lambda (index $0 $2)) (range $0)))) $0 (length (cdr $0))))
  (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (map (lambda (index $0 $2)) (range $0)))) $0 #(+ #(+ 1 1) #(+ 1 1))))
