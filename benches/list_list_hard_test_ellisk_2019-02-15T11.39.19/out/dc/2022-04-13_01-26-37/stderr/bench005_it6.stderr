Timing point 3 (all scoring): 6.19871s.
Improved score to -803.541071 (dScore=0.203569) w/ new primitive
	#(lambda (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (fold $1 $0 (lambda (lambda (cons $1 $0)))))) $1 (cons $0 empty)))) : list(t0) -> t0 -> list(t0)
rewrote all of the frontiers in 7.79124s.
Timing point 4 (rewrite final frontiers): 7.79128s.
Completed one step of memory consolidation in 40.1409s.
New primitive is used 3 times in the best programs in each of the frontiers.
Here is where it is used:
  (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (fold $1 $0 (lambda (lambda (cons $1 $0)))))) $1 (cons $0 empty)))) $0 0))
  (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (fold $1 $0 (lambda (lambda (cons $1 $0)))))) $1 (cons $0 empty)))) $0 (#(lambda (+ 1 (+ 1 $0))) #(#(lambda (+ 1 (+ 1 $0))) 1))))
