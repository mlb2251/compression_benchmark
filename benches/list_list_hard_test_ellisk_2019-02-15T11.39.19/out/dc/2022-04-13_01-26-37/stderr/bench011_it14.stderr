Initial language score: 0.000000
Initial joint score: -1154.047433 using LC of 0.000000
Here in the master worker: we still have 0 language alignments;
Scored candidates in 5.23626s.
Best MDL score: -1153.931091 with (lambda (map (lambda (gt? $0 $1))))
Scored candidates with language and grammar in 5.25964s.
Best joint score: -1153.931091 with (lambda (map (lambda (gt? $0 $1))))
Timing point 3 (all scoring): 10.533s.
Improved score to -1153.931091 (dScore=0.116343) w/ new primitive
	#(lambda (map (lambda (gt? $0 $1)))) : int -> list(int) -> list(bool)
rewrote all of the frontiers in 6.34169s.
Timing point 4 (rewrite final frontiers): 6.34173s.
Completed one step of memory consolidation in 45.0345s.
New primitive is used 2 times in the best programs in each of the frontiers.
Here is where it is used:
  (lambda (#(lambda (map (lambda (gt? $0 $1)))) 0 $0))
  (lambda (#(lambda (map (lambda (gt? $0 $1)))) #(#(lambda (+ 1 (+ 1 $0))) 1) $0))
