Timing point 3 (all scoring): 3.54365s.
Improved score to -648.633843 (dScore=7.812035) w/ new primitive
	#(lambda (lambda (fold $1 $0 (lambda (lambda (if (gt? $0 $1) $0 $1)))))) : list(int) -> int -> int
rewrote all of the frontiers in 7.91518s.
Timing point 4 (rewrite final frontiers): 7.91523s.

New primitive is used 2 times in the best programs in each of the frontiers.
Here is where it is used:
  (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (fold $1 $0 (lambda (lambda (if (gt? $0 $1) $0 $1)))))) $0 0))
  (lambda (+ 1 (#(lambda (lambda (fold $1 $0 (lambda (lambda (if (gt? $0 $1) $0 $1)))))) $0 #(#(lambda (+ 1 (+ 1 $0))) 1))))
