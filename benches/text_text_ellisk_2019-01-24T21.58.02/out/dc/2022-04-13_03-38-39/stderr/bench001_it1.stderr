Here in the master worker: we still have 0 language alignments;
Scored candidates in 355.706ms.
Best MDL score: -214.167107 with (lambda (lambda (cons (car $1) (cons $0 empty))))
Scored candidates with language and grammar in 386.698ms.

Timing point 3 (all scoring): 746.17ms.
Improved score to -214.167107 (dScore=7.818323) w/ new primitive
	#(lambda (lambda (cons (car $1) (cons $0 empty)))) : list(t0) -> t0 -> list(t0)
rewrote all of the frontiers in 6.19022s.
Timing point 4 (rewrite final frontiers): 6.19027s.
Completed one step of memory consolidation in 26.6473s.
New primitive is used 3 times in the best programs in each of the frontiers.
Here is where it is used:
  (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (cons (car $1) (cons $0 empty)))) $0 ','))
  (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (cons (car $1) (cons $0 empty)))) $0 '-'))
  (lambda (lambda (cons (car $1) (cons '.' (#(lambda (lambda (cons (car $1) (cons $0 empty)))) $0 '.')))))
