Timing point 3 (all scoring): 2.69233s.
Improved score to -542.550699 (dScore=2.345295) w/ new primitive
	#(lambda (cdr (cdr $0))) : list(t0) -> list(t0)
rewrote all of the frontiers in 7.99755s.
Timing point 4 (rewrite final frontiers): 7.9976s.
Completed one step of memory consolidation in 41.8218s.
New primitive is used 6 times in the best programs in each of the frontiers.
Here is where it is used:

  (lambda (cdr (#(lambda (cdr (cdr $0))) (#(lambda (cdr (cdr $0))) $0))))
  (lambda (is-square (+ 1 (mod (car $0) (index (length (#(lambda (cdr (cdr $0))) $0)) $0)))))
