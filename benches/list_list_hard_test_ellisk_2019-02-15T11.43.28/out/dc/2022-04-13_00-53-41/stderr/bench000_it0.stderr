rewrote all of the frontiers in 6.63323s.
Timing point 4 (rewrite final frontiers): 6.63327s.
Completed one step of memory consolidation in 36.3492s.
New primitive is used 4 times in the best programs in each of the frontiers.
Here is where it is used:
  (lambda (map (lambda (+ $0 (+ 1 #(+ 1 (+ 1 1))))) $0))
  (lambda (map (lambda (eq? $0 #(+ 1 (+ 1 1)))) $0))
  (lambda (eq? 1 (fold $0 1 (lambda (lambda (- $0 (mod $1 #(+ 1 (+ 1 1)))))))))
