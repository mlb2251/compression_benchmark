Timing point 3 (all scoring): 3.46686s.
Improved score to -609.832611 (dScore=5.553665) w/ new primitive
	#(lambda (lambda (fold $1 empty (lambda (lambda (fold ($2 $1 range) $0 (lambda (lambda (cons $3 $2))))))))) : list(t0) -> (t0 -> (int -> list(int)) -> list(t1)) -> list(t0)

Timing point 4 (rewrite final frontiers): 11.0339s.
Completed one step of memory consolidation in 51.491s.
New primitive is used 2 times in the best programs in each of the frontiers.
Here is where it is used:
  (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (fold $1 empty (lambda (lambda (fold ($2 $1 range) $0 (lambda (lambda (cons $3 $2))))))))) $0 (lambda (lambda ($0 $1)))))
  (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (fold $1 empty (lambda (lambda (fold ($2 $1 range) $0 (lambda (lambda (cons $3 $2))))))))) $0 (lambda (lambda ($0 (- $1 #(+ 1 (+ 1 1))))))))
