Initial language score: 0.000000
Initial joint score: -297.129141 using LC of 0.000000
Here in the master worker: we still have 0 language alignments;
Scored candidates in 563.767ms.
Best MDL score: -296.934226 with (lambda (cdr (cdr (cdr $0))))
Scored candidates with language and grammar in 509.64ms.
Best joint score: -296.934226 with (lambda (cdr (cdr (cdr $0))))
Timing point 3 (all scoring): 1.08823s.
Improved score to -296.934226 (dScore=0.194915) w/ new primitive
	#(lambda (cdr (cdr (cdr $0)))) : list(t0) -> list(t0)
rewrote all of the frontiers in 6.59385s.
Timing point 4 (rewrite final frontiers): 6.5939s.
Completed one step of memory consolidation in 34.4152s.
New primitive is used 3 times in the best programs in each of the frontiers.
Here is where it is used:
  (lambda (cons (car (#(lambda (cdr (cdr (cdr $0)))) $0)) $0))
  (lambda (map (lambda (index $0 (#(lambda (cdr (cdr (cdr $0)))) $1))) (range (+ 1 (+ 1 1)))))
  (lambda (fold (cdr (#(lambda (cdr (cdr (cdr $0)))) $0)) $0 (lambda (lambda (cons $1 (cons (car $0) empty))))))
