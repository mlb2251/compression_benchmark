	#(lambda (gt? $0 0)) : int -> bool
rewrote all of the frontiers in 6.24255s.
Timing point 4 (rewrite final frontiers): 6.24261s.
Completed one step of memory consolidation in 33.1065s.
New primitive is used 4 times in the best programs in each of the frontiers.
Here is where it is used:
  (lambda (map (lambda (#(lambda (gt? $0 0)) (+ $0 1))) $0))
  (lambda (map (lambda (#(lambda (gt? $0 0)) $0)) $0))
  (lambda (if (is-prime (length $0)) (is-prime (car $0)) (#(lambda (gt? $0 0)) (length $0))))
