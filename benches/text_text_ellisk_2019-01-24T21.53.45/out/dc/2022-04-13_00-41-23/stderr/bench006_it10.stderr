Timing point 3 (all scoring): 5.24946s.
Improved score to -668.628740 (dScore=1.376223) w/ new primitive
	#(lambda (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (map (lambda (index $0 $2)) (range ($0 (+ 1)))))) $1 (lambda (- (length $2) ($0 ($1 $0))))))) : list(t0) -> ((int -> int) -> int) -> list(t0)
rewrote all of the frontiers in 11.275s.
Timing point 4 (rewrite final frontiers): 11.275s.
Completed one step of memory consolidation in 54.4175s.
New primitive is used 3 times in the best programs in each of the frontiers.
Here is where it is used:
