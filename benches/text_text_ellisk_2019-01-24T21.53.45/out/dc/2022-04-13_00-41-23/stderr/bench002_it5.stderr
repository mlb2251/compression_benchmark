Scored candidates with language and grammar in 1.48958s.
Best joint score: -467.721546 with (lambda (lambda (map (lambda (index $0 $2)) (range ($0 (+ 1))))))
Timing point 3 (all scoring): 3.13349s.
Improved score to -467.721546 (dScore=0.303376) w/ new primitive
	#(lambda (lambda (map (lambda (index $0 $2)) (range ($0 (+ 1)))))) : list(t0) -> ((int -> int) -> int) -> list(t0)

New primitive is used 2 times in the best programs in each of the frontiers.
Here is where it is used:
  (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (map (lambda (index $0 $2)) (range ($0 (+ 1)))))) $0 (lambda ($0 ($0 1)))))
  (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (map (lambda (index $0 $2)) (range ($0 (+ 1)))))) $0 (lambda (- (length $1) ($0 ($0 ($0 ($0 1))))))))
