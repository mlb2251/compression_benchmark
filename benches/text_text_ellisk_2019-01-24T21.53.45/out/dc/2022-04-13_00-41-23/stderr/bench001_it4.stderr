Here in the master worker: we still have 0 language alignments;
Scored candidates in 1.04001s.
Best MDL score: -411.857656 with (lambda (lambda (cons (car $0) (#(cons '.') (cons (car $1) (#(cons '.') empty))))))
Scored candidates with language and grammar in 1.12567s.

Timing point 3 (all scoring): 2.17386s.
Improved score to -411.857656 (dScore=11.795889) w/ new primitive
	#(lambda (lambda (cons (car $0) (#(cons '.') (cons (car $1) (#(cons '.') empty)))))) : list(char) -> list(char) -> list(char)
rewrote all of the frontiers in 9.33154s.
Timing point 4 (rewrite final frontiers): 9.33176s.
Completed one step of memory consolidation in 54.139s.
New primitive is used 2 times in the best programs in each of the frontiers.
Here is where it is used:
  (lambda (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (cons (car $0) (#(cons '.') (cons (car $1) (#(cons '.') empty)))))) $0 $1)))
  (lambda (lambda (#(lambda (lambda (cons (car $0) (#(cons '.') (cons (car $1) (#(cons '.') empty)))))) $0 $1)))
